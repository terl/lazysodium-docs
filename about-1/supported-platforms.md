# Supported platforms

Lazysodium can support any reasonably modern machine with a reasonably modern architecture. As Lazysodium is binding on Libsodium, Lazysodium is constrained by Libsodium's supported CPU architectures which can be found [here](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/tree/master/dist-build). Therefore Lazysodium currently supports:

* Windows 7 and above.
* Ubuntu 14.04 and above\*.
* Android 16 and above.
* iOS 10.2 and above.
* MacOS 10.11 and above.
* Arm6 and above \(e.g. Raspberry Pi 1 and above\).

\*Support for other linux distros can _theoretically_ be added by cross-compilation, just [create](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java/issues) a GitHub issue and we'll see what we can do.
