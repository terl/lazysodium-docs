# About

## Why Lazysodium?

The problem with current cryptography libraries is that they can be one of 4 things: difficult to use, poorly documented, out of date or poorly architected.

So we built Lazysodium to make it **absolutely effortless** to get started with cryptography. We picked [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) `1.0.16` as our underlying C library. Libsodium is an immensely powerful, well-tested and well-audited cryptography library that we found was perfect for securing all types of things.

### A small example

Compare the two ways you could use Lazysodium:

**1. Using native functions**

The following shows how to create a subkey from a master key. The subkey can then be used to encrypt and decrypt text.

```java
byte[] subkey = subkey[32];
byte[] context = "Examples".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
byte[] masterKey = "a_master_key_of_length_32_bytes!".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
int result = lazySodium.cryptoKdfDeriveFromKey(subkey, subkey.length, 1L, context, masterKey);

// Now check the result
if (res == 0) {
    // We have a positive result. Let's store it in a database.
    String subkeyString = new String(subkey, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
}
```

**2. Or use Lazysodium's lazy functions**

You could use the above native functions **or** you could use the "Lazy" functions ðŸ˜„

```java
String context = "Examples";
String masterKeyStr = "a_master_key_of_length_32_bytes!";
Key masterKey = Key.fromPlainString(masterKeyStr);
Key subKey = lazySodium.cryptoKdfDeriveFromKey(KeyDerivation.BYTES_MIN, 1L, context, masterKey);
System.out.println(subKey.getAsHexString());
// 20808D40E92E968AC65F4A95A015116C
```

As you can see Lazysodium makes cryptography effortless!

## Apps

There is a Lazysodium app available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goterl.lazycode.lazysodium.example) that shows you some encryption and hashing operations:

## Supported languages

Currently Lazysodium only supports [Android](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-android) and [Java](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java). You can also drop Lazysodium in Kotlin projects via [Lazysodium for Java](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java).
