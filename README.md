### Important info

We urge you to consider using [Hydride](https://github.com/libly/hydride-java) instead of Lazysodium. Hydride is a wrapper over Libydrogen, Lazysodium is a wrapper over Libsodium. Hydride supports more platforms and is a lot more simpler both in terms of code and usage, but has less functions. Therefore, please consider your needs carefully. If your needs are basic then use [Hydride](https://github.com/libly/hydride-java).
