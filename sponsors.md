# Sponsors

### Why sponsor us?

Sponsorship keeps our open-source projects running. We want our open-source projects running independently from our business \[Terl\]\(https://terl.co\) because that way:

* They are not tied to the longevity of our business.
* They are not tied to the financial incentives of our business.
* They remain open-source forever.
* They live a long time.

You can find out more about why we've decided to have supporters on our [supporters information page](https://terl.co/support-us).

### Benefits

In order to become a sponsor you must be willing to commit at least **Â£5,000** per month for at least **one year**. Though, that number is entirely flexible. The higher the number the more benefits we provide. You can also become a [supporter](https://docs.lazycode.co/lazysodium/faq#who-funds-lazysodium) if that number's a bit too high.

Sponsors receive organisation-wide 12 hour support/bug/feature requests on all our open-source projects plus a wide array of other benefits such as:

* Discounts on all our products and services.
* Free one-to-one support from our devs, max 5 hour consultations per month.
* Merchandise.
* Some advertisement of your products and services on a yearly basis \(e.g. reviews\).
